# Driving Buddy

An app to track your driving, gas and parktickets.

This app is intended to work by the user inputting values from the car's odometer and determining the distance that way. I have no intention to add GPS *tracking* to this app, however I do intend to automatically detect start and end locations.

- [Flexify](https://github.com/brandonp2412/Flexify): I have next to no knowledge of Flutter, so I used Flexify as a base for designing my app and getting to know Flutter.
